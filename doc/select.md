# Select Feature

The select feature is highly customizable and extensible. It is similar to the quickfix list of vim/neovim. The most basic example of its use is as follows:

## Basic Usage

1. Populate the selection list with all DOM elements that match a given [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors):
```vim
:selectset h2

" this populates the selection list with all `h2` header elements from the page.
```

2. Navigate back and forth through these selections with `<C-j>` and `<C-k>`
3. Use the return/enter key or `<C-l>` to click on the given object. By default it will search within the element for the first link (`<a>` tag) and navigate to that link.


## Commands

All commands for configuring this feature are:

| command						| description															| abbreviation	|
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| :selectset `<query>`          | set the query used to populate the selection list                     | sset 			|
| :selectsetclick `<query>`		| set query used to get element within selection to click (default 'a')	| ssclick		|
| :selectstyle `<css>`          | set the CSS style for the focused selection							| ssty			|
| :selecttag `<index>`          | tag the focused selection, a specific index, or a list of indices     | stag			|


## Configuration

Settings for this feature can automatically be loaded on web pages using your config files. This is particularly useful for [site specific configurations](./site.html).

For example, here is a basic configuration for navigating amazon search results:
```vim
site '*://*.amazon.com/s*' {
    call :sset '[data-component-type="s-search-result"]'
	call :ssty 'border: 4px solid darkslateblue;'

	map j :selectnextCR>
	map k :selectprev<CR>
}
```

A useful way of organizing these site specific configurations could be to create files such as `amazon.cvim` in the directory `~/.config/cvim/sites/`.
