# Style Guide

Overall compact syntax is favored. Smaller is better except at the expence of clarity.

## Objects

Object methods should be written as arrow functions. It is already clear in this situation that we are defining an object method, so the word "function" would be redundant, distracting, and add clutter.

## Functions

The following function definitions should use arrow notation and no "function" keyword:
* .map, .forEach, .reduce, etc.
* object methods
